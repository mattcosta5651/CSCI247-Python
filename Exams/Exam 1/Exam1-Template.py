# Determines the number of people speeding during 
# rush hour and not during rush hour.  Also determines
# the total fines during rush hour and not during 
# rush hour.  A person is considered speeding if they
# are traveling faster than 69 MPH.  The fine for 
# speeding during rush hour is $150.  The fine for 
# speeding not during rush hour is $100.
#
# THE CORRECT OUTPUT IS:
#
# The average speed during rush hour was 63.47.
# The average speed not during rush hour was 64.07.
# There were 4 speeders during rush hour.  Total fine = $600
# There were 6 speeders not during rush hour.  Total fine = $600
